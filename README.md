# ITS-275-ProjectMK
A project for ITS 275 at Campbell University by Kaitlyn Keesee and Malia McKay.
Both students worked together to write this code. 

This project creates a "Customer Viewer" that prints information about customers 1001, 1002, and 1003 when these numbers are entered by the user. 

Any other customer number that is entered will result in the message: "There is no customer ___ in our records".

After each customer the message, "Would you like to display another customer? Yes or No?", is displayed. This process will repeat until the user types "no".
